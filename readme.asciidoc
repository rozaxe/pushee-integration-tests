= Aerogear Unified Push server integration tests 

== Idea

Push EE is an application running on top of an application server. Arquillian
can deploy an app, so the remaining workload is to figure out how to replace
curl in an convenient way from Java.

Integration tests will be kept separated until we release a stable version of
Groovy and Spock runner. Then, they will be moved into standard layout and
executed via failsafe plugin in integration-tests phase.

=== Description of the testing approach

I tried following approaches:

* Manual using Apache HttpClient
* DSL API
* JSONObject to work with JSON
* GSON serialization
* REST-Assured framework

All are listed here: https://gist.github.com/kpiwko/5612949

In the end it seems that Groovy is the most readable while not impacting test infrastructure that heavily.

== Requirements

. Get Arquillian Spock Testrunner and install it into your local Maven repository from https://github.com/kpiwko/arquillian-testrunner-spock/tree/ARQ-1143 
. Fetch Unified push server code and put it into same directory and integration tests, e.g.
+
----
workdir/pushee
workdir/pushee-integration-tests
----    
+
Or, you can specify path to Unified Push server pom.xml file via `-Dunified.push.server.location=/path/to/pom.xml`

. By default, it uses JBoss AS 7.1.1. Run `mvn clean verify`

=== How to run against JBoss EAP 6

. Get JBoss EAP 6.0.1 zip and extract it somewhere
. Set Maven Enterprise repository in your settings.xml (https://maven.repository.redhat.com/techpreview/all/)
. Run `mvn clean verify -Peap601-managed -DjbossHome=/path/to/eap/directory`

=== How to develop new tests

To speed up tests development, following tricks are advised:

. Run container in remote mode
. Deploy application on your own and replace @ArquillianResource URL with a static URL and comment out @Deployment method

=== TODO

* It might be interesting to use suite extension of Arquillian, that would deploy Unified Push Server only once per all tests.
